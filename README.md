## Hello 👋🏼

  I'm currently working on a breakthrough in memory-safety and low-level database primitives [@alias-research](https://github.com/alias-research). I'm actively researching memory models that scale, systems that don't have to compromise, and architectures that **could** change the world. I also build the Rust tooling I need to make the above work possible.

  **Current work:**

- [**cargo-rail**](https://github.com/alias-research/cargo-rail) — Workspace orchestration for Rust monorepos. Split/sync with history preservation, graph-aware CI, policy enforcement, release coordination.
- Novel SMR (safe memory reclamation) scheme and HLC implementation
- Consensus algorithms and distributed systems design challenges
- Database internals - temporal indexing, versioned storage layers, zero-copy query execution

<br/>

**Philosophy:** Strip the idea to it's simplest atomic components/structure first; build from there. It's the only way to get anything significant done.
