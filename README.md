## Hey, I'm LoadingALIAS

Rust, Distributed Systems and Database Engineer. Pushing the envelope.

### What I'm Building

I'm working on a startup at [@alias-research](https://github.com/alias-research) anchored in a breakthrough I believe I've made in safe memory reclamation.

This has unlocked new, low-level database primitives I'm actively developing: a novel SMR scheme, a high-performance timing system, a new consensus algorithm and distributed system architecture, and unconventional database internals that I think impact all of us more than we initially realized.

I build memory models that scale; systems that don't compromise; architectures that **could** change the world.

### Current OSS Work

**[cargo-rail](https://github.com/loadingalias/cargo-rail)**: workspace orchestration tooling for Rust monorepos; born out of necessity for the work above.

- The leanest, full-featured build graph at any given point across the workspace
- Graph-aware change detection for checks, tests, and benchmarks locally and in CI pipes (See: [cargo-rail-action](https://github.com/loadingalias/cargo-rail-action))
- Split and bi-directionally sync crate/s with full history preservation to new OSS repos
- Release, publish, and maintain without pulling in 600+ dependencies
